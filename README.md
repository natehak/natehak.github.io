This website has a few HTML5 2D Canvas demos.
It randomly cycles between them.

The first is the `bouncer.js` which has my full name bounce around the edges
of the browser (much like the DVD player idle screens). With each click it
intensifies the animation adding color and more bouncing items.

The second is the `bloomer.js` which is a
[video feedback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_feedback) system.
The feedback has a rotation whose value randomly walks, a slight
translation which is controlled by the pointer (or last tap location on
mobile), and a slight zoom which can be controlled by scrolling.
